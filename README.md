# Personal Website

This is my first experience with CSS and ReactJS. I began this project by following the following YouTube video:

From this tutorial, I made a home page, about page, contact page, portfolio page, and linked sidebar. Once I created this baseline, I customized each page to fit my needs and expand on the video's teaching. I redesigned with a new color pallette, logo, edited graphics design, and additional features. 

My goal for this project was to experiment with front-end design, CSS, and React for the first time. I enjoy the creative design process and being able to create a personalized final product. 

### Home Page 
I designed my own simple logo, imported it as a svg, and animated it. 

### Contact Page
For the contact page, I used the 'emailjs' library so the user can automatically send me emails through the webpage. 

### Portfolio Page 
The portfolio items consist of an image and a link to the GitHub repository, so the website will redirect to the repo when the button is pressed. 

### About Page 
In addition to the original page design, I chose to include a square grid of images. 

# Reflection 
Looking forward, there is still a lot to learn about React, are many features I would like to develop further. For example, I would like to change how the Portfolio Page stores its data, and allow the user to press the button to view the repository in a sub-window, not leaving the window. Further, I would like to change the image gallery on the About Page to be a scrolling image display, no longer static. Also, I would like to incorporate more graphics and animations to make the websit for visually interesting and personal.
